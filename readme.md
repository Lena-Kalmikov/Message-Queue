## Messaging app

The goal of this project was to practice, implement, and use different data structures, such as linked list, double linked list, queue and hash table.
This was done by creating a messaging app.

Written in C# using .Net Framework.

Application: 
1. Send a message to a contact.
2. See all existing contacts.
3. Read and delete oldest message from a specific contact.
4. Read and delete oldest message in the system (where all messages from all contacts are saved).
5. Read a desired number of oldest or newest messages. 
6. Read messages by date.
7. Search messages for a specific word.
